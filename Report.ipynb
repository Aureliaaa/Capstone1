    "The clustering result reveals that London and Toronto are very similar based on the most common venues in their neighbourhoods. \n",
    "\n",
    "Both cities have a lot of coffee shops, which is probably true in most western countries. Also, both cities have a wide variety of restaurants, ranging from Italian and French to Japanese and Chinese restaurants. This reflects the fact that both cities are culturally diverse. Different cultures are celebrated and embraced in both cities. Therefore, if you are considering studying or working abroad in either London or Toronto, you may not worry too much about the cultural issues. It is very likely that you will find some signs of your own culture, such as a restaurant which provides food from your hometown. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, there does exist some differences between London and Toronto. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, Toronto tends to have more parks than London does. This is a very positive sign, especially for a large crowded city like Toronto. If you are thinking about living abroad for a long period of time, the living environment is an important factor to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, London tends to have more theatres, exhibits and bookstores than Toronto does. As we all know, London is famous for its rich history, cultures and arts, so I am not surprised to discover this difference. For people who are interested in history or arts, London is an ideal place to experience and learn the European culture. \n",
    "\n",
    "With increasing globalization, major cities around the world tend to become more similar in terms of city designs. However, they still have unique history backgrounds and cultures, which make them different from each other to some extent. For researchers in the field of urban studies, I hope this project can provide you with additional insights into the difference between the European and North American cities. "
